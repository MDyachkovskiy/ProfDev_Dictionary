<p id="description">This project was completed as part of the training course: "Professional development of Android applications". During the course, an explanatory dictionary project was developed, which finds the definition of the inputted word using the API at https://api.dictionaryapi.dev. To enhance the retention of the found word, the program automatically selects a pictorial association from the API at https://dictionary.skyeng.ru to bolster memorization efforts.</p>
